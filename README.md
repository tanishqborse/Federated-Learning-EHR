# 📌 Federated Learning for Electronic Health Records (EHR)

## 🌍 Overview
**Federated Learning (FL)** is an innovative approach to training machine learning models across decentralized datasets without transferring sensitive data. This project explores the **security and privacy challenges** in implementing **FL in Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** and evaluates countermeasures to enhance its robustness.

---

## 🏥 Motivation
EHRs contain **highly sensitive medical data**, making their centralized storage and processing vulnerable to **data breaches**. FL provides a solution by enabling **privacy-preserving collaborative learning** across multiple healthcare institutions. However, FL also introduces **security threats**, such as poisoning attacks, inference attacks, and communication vulnerabilities, which this research aims to address.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
✅ Investigate **security challenges** in FL for EHR data.
✅ Identify and evaluate **privacy risks** in FL models.
✅ Implement and analyze **defensive techniques** to mitigate security threats.
✅ Propose a **secure FL framework** optimized for EHR applications.
